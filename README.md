## 🏗️ Employee Attendance & Payroll Management System
---
**Project Type:** Personal Business Tool | Platform: Microsoft Excel + VBA | Scope: Employee Management, Attendance Tracking & Payroll Automation

#### Overview:
A robust Excel-based system designed to automate and streamline the process of tracking employee attendance, calculating payroll, and managing employee data. This system handles multiple employee sheets for both staff and workers, integrates with payroll calculations, and produces a comprehensive summary sheet with aggregated data. Built using VBA automation, the tool ensures accurate and efficient data entry, improves visibility into employee performance, and reduces manual intervention in payroll processing.


#### Key Features & Contributions:
* **🔄 Employee Sheet Duplication & Data Entry**
 Automated the creation of individual attendance sheets for employees (both staff and workers) based on pre-existing templates. Each sheet is populated with employee-specific data such as position, salary components, and attendance details.
* **💼 Payroll Calculation Engine:**
The system automates payroll calculations, including:
  * Basic Salary: Derived from the employee sheet.
  * Overtime: Based on hours worked beyond the standard time and calculated at a premium rate.
  * Deductions: Handles deductions based on absence, late arrivals, early checkouts, and leave days.
  * Bonuses: Applied based on employee performance and other criteria.
* **📊 Dynamic Summary Sheet**
Aggregated data from multiple employee sheets is automatically transferred into a Summary Sheet, showing key metrics like total salary, overtime, leave days, and deductions. The summary is updated automatically when changes are made to employee sheets, ensuring a live feed of payroll information.
* **🧑‍💼 Employee Type Classification**
 The system automatically classifies employees as Staff or Worker by cross-referencing a centralized Employee Table in the Key Sheet. This classification ensures that the correct payroll formulas and attendance rules are applied based on employee type.
* **⏱️ Attendance Tracking & Automation**
 Tracks daily attendance for each employee, noting any discrepancies such as "No Punch" (missing time-in or time-out), absences, late arrivals, and early departures. The system ensures that overtime, deductions, and special conditions (like Ramadan hours) are calculated correctly.
* **📅 Dynamic Data Sync**
 Employee details are automatically updated on the Summary Sheet whenever there are changes to individual employee sheets, ensuring real-time synchronization and visibility. The summary sheet is linked to all employee data, minimizing manual intervention.
* **📑 Macro Automation**
 VBA macros are used to automate:
  * Employee Sheet Duplication: Automatically creates and fills in new sheets based on employee data.
  * Payroll Calculation: Automatically recalculates payroll whenever attendance or salary data is updated.
  * Summary Sheet Updates: Aggregates data from employee sheets and synchronizes the summary without manual data entry.
* **💻 Error Detection & Data Integrity**
 The system checks for errors such as missing employee data in the Biomaster Sheet or discrepancies in employee sheets. Any missing records are flagged, and reports are generated to indicate employees who need corrections.

#### Impact:
The Employee Attendance & Payroll Management System has significantly reduced the time required to process payroll (by automating the tracking, calculation, and reporting of attendance and salary data). The automation of employee sheet management and payroll calculation has minimized human error, increased data integrity, and improved decision-making by providing real-time updates on employee performance, attendance, and costs. The tool also ensured better resource management and time tracking for both staff and workers, ultimately improving operational efficiency and reducing administrative overhead by 60%.
